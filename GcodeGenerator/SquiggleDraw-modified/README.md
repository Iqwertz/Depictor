# SquiggleDraw

SquiggleDraw will create a SVG file from an image, using the brightness to change the amplitude of sine waves. It is easier to look at the examples below to better understand. :-)

You can use the saved SVG file to print from Inkscape/AI/etc, draw with a pen on a pen plotter (like the awesome AxiDraw), or engrave with a lasercutter (it looks cool!)

This is code for Processing (http://processing.org)

Additional dependency: Download and install controlP5 in your processing libraries directory. ( http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/ )


Features: 
* Simple UI to load/save images, adjust parameters related to the sine waves, and basic image adjustements
* Saved SVG is larger than original image for detail
